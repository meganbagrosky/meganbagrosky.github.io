                Hello, my name is Megan Bagrosky I am a third year Junior at the University of Oklahoma.
                I am currently double majoring in Supply Chain Management and MIS with a minor in Marketing.
                My goal is to apply learned business skills in professional business settings.
                I have a strong history of teamwork and goal achievement that is demonstrated through
                through coursework and years of contributing to student organizations. I am dedicated to
                learning, meeting objectives, exceeding expectations and bringing strong work ethic and
                commitment to quality performance. Through this webpage, I am hoping you will learn a little
                more about me and the work I have completed during my college experience.
